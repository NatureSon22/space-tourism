### Space Tourism Project

This Space Tourism project from Frontend Mentor provided a valuable learning experience. It challenged me to apply and improve my skills in Tailwind CSS. Working on this project, I gained understanding of Tailwind's utility classes and how to use them effectively to build a responsive and visually appealing design. While it was challenging at times, it was also a rewarding process that helped me grow as a front-end developer. That said, I recognize that this project is not perfect and still has room for improvement.
